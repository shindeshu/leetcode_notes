## Problem - Easy

## Solution

Check the current node and the next node. IF values are same, skip the next node to go directly to next.next node

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = head
        if prev and prev.next:
            # need to have both prev and next
            if prev.val == prev.next.val:
                # if two consecutive same values
                # then skip the prev.next
                prev = prev.next.next
            else:
                # if dissimilar values, inc like normal
                prev = prev.next
        return head
```
