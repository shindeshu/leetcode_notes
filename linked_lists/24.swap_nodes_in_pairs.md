## Problem

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [2,1,4,3]

Explanation:

## Solution

Initialize two pointers, prev at dummy (because of list being changed), and curr at head.

D, 1, 2, 3, 4
P, C

To start the while loop, we need to ensure that C & C.next both are non empty, since we need at least two nodes to reverse.

At the end of the first loop, the list should look like:

D, 2, 1, 3, 4
      P, C

### First loop
Starting as

D, 1, 2, 3, 4
P, C

Store the next pairs starting point in a variable (nxtPair = C.next.next) and also the second node of current pair (S=C.next)

D, 1, 2, 3, 4
P, C, S, N

Rearrange the pointers

1. S should point to C (i.e. reversing 1->2 to become 2->1)
2. C should point to N (i.e. 1->2 becomes 1->3)

Now the list becomes

2->1->3->4->...
S  C  N
   â†‘
   0
   P
(But the prev pointer still points to 1!)
3. P should point to S (null->1 becomes null->2)

becoming

D->2->1->3->4->...
P  S  C  N

Increment the pointers

P = C
C = N

Finally,

D->2->1->3->4->...
      P  C

For the next iteration

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = prev = ListNode(next=head)
        curr = head

        while curr and curr.next:
            print("-----")
            nxtPair = curr.next.next
            second = curr.next
            print(f'P:{prev.val}, C:{curr.val}')
            self.printList(dummy)

            second.next = curr
            curr.next = nxtPair
            prev.next = second

            # incrementing
            prev = curr
            curr = nxtPair
        return dummy.next

    def printList(self, list1):
        result = []
        while list1:
            result.append(str(list1.val))
            list1 = list1.next
        print("->".join(result))
```
