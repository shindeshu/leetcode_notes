## Problem

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Solution

create a new null node to add nodes to it. dummy = head = ListNode()

while both lists are non-empty, check which node value is lesser. append that to the new list.
whenever you append from list1, increment that list only, not the other
finally, increment the new list since we need to append to that list.

Edge cases: if one list is empty, other is not. handle that separately at the end.

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not list1: return list2
        if not list2: return list1

        dummy = head = ListNode()
        while list1 and list2:
            # both lists are non-empty
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                head.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                head.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            head = head.next
        if list1:
            head.next = list1
        if list2:
            head.next = list2
        return dummy.next
```
