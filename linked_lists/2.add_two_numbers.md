You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

2 → 4 → 3

5 → 6 → 4

Output:

7 → 0 → 8

Explanation: 342+465=807

## Solution

Note that the head is at the last decimal place (place value=1), so we can directly add both heads, and add the next one, and next one, etc.
we just need to take care of the carry, and if one of the lists is larger than the other.

Trick:

run the while loop, if EITHER L1 exists, OR L2 exists, OR carry exists (i.e. ==1)

why OR and not AND?

because if one of the lists is empty and other is not, the loop still runs! we simply dont add any value from the null list, only add the other list's node value and carry.

if BOTH lists are empty, and carry is 1, the loop is still executed. we dont add any values from the lists, we only add the carry in a new node.

if BOTH lists are empty, carry is zero, the addition is complete, while loop ends.
