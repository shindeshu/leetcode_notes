## Problem

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

## Solution

iterate k times to find the kth node
reverse the list
rearrange pointers.

last part is toughest, complete explanation todo

## Code

From neetcode

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        groupPrev = dummy
        while True:
            # shift curr next till k
            kth = groupPrev
            for i in range(k):
                if not kth:
                    break
                kth = kth.next
            if not kth:
                break
            groupNext = kth.next
            # kth is the kth node in this group
            # groupPrev is the last node of prev group,
            #   initialized to dummy/null intially.
            # groupNext is the first node of next group
            # now we reverse the list from groupPrev to kth
            
            # normal list reversing

            # this special case reversing
            prev, curr = kth.next, groupPrev.next
            # why? curr is self-explanatory
            # prev is pointing to next group, since at the end
            # we want prev pointing to it, not null!
            # groupPrev->nodes-to-reverse->kth->groupNext
            #            C                      P
            # finally
            # groupPrev->reversed-nodes->kth.next
            while curr!=groupNext:
                # unlike normal, where curr!=None
                temp = curr.next # store next node
                curr.next = prev # reverse the link
                prev = curr # increment
                curr = temp

            groupPrev = temp
        return dummy.next
