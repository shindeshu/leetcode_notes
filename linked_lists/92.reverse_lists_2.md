## Problem

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

## Solution

track three positions: 
- leftPrev (node just before the left target)
- curr (node initially on the left target)
- prev (node used for reversing, initially None)

initialize a dummy node. leftPrev = dummy, curr = head.
increment till curr is at left target, leftPrev just before that.

now, prev = None, and curr -> reverse this list (use for loop instead of while, bcoz number of nodes)
after reversing, prev is at the head of this reversed list.
where is curr? it is at the node just after right target.

in a nutshell you have three lists: (dummy to leftPrev to end-of-reversed-string) this is the first section, (prev to null) this is the reversed string, (curr to null) this is the last part. now you just need to connect these together. how?

leftPrev.next (end of reversed string) --> curr (beginning of last string)
leftPrev (end of first section) -> prev (start of the middle section, i.e. reversed)

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        leftPrev, curr = dummy, head
        # move leftPrev to just before L & curr at L
        for i in range(left-1):
            curr, leftPrev = curr.next, leftPrev.next
        
        # reverse from left to right
        # use for loop instead of while
        # since the number of nodes is available
        prev = None
        for i in range(right-left+1):
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
        # connect the endofthe reversed list (at leftPrev.next)
        # with the right-side of the original list (at curr)
        leftPrev.next.next = curr
        # connect the left-side of the original list (leftPrev)
        # with the head of the reversed list (at prev)
        leftPrev.next = prev
        return dummy.next
```
