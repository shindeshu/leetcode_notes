## Problem

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]


## Solution

Array instinct - start from the right, count backwards to get to the nth element from right. This is not possible in a linkedlist since we can only go from left to right.

Trick: have two pointers, starting at head. first, move right pointer n times ahead. then move both pointers ahead till the right pointer reaches the last node. VIOLA! the left pointer is now just before the node that we needed to remove!

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        L = R = dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        # increment R by n times
        while n and R:
            R = R.next
            n -= 1
        while R.next:
            L = L.next
            R = R.next
        # L is just before the target node
        L.next = L.next.next
        return dummy.next
        
```
