## Problem

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

## Solution

Create two nodes L and R (and dummies for both respectively)

Start iterating with head. If < target, add to L, increment. If > target, add to R, increment.

Finally, connect L with R, and ensure R.next = None

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        L = d1 = ListNode()
        R = d2 = ListNode()
        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                L.next = head
                L = L.next
            else:
                R.next = head
                R = R.next
            head = head.next
        # L & R are at the tails of their lists now
        L.next = d2.next
        R.next = None
        return d1.next
        
            
```
