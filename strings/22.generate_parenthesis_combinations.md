## Problem

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
 

## Solution

We use backtracking to create the combinations.

Note that final string will contain n open brackets and n closed brackets (total 2*n). Also a string must always start with an open bracket.

At each step we can either choose "(" or ")" based on some conditions, and then recursively keep doing till final condition.

What are the conditions to add "(" to the result string? If number of open brackets < n, then we need to add more open brackets. If number of closed brackets is less than number of open brackets (i.e. too many open brackets) we need to add more closed brackets. If the total length reaches 2*n we add the string to result.

                res.append(s)
                return
            if open_brackets < n:
                dfs(s+"(", open_brackets+1, closed_brackets)
            if closed_brackets < open_brackets:
                dfs(s+")", open_brackets, closed_brackets+1)
        
        dfs("(", 1, 0)
        return res
