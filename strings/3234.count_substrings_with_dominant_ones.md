## Problem

You are given a binary string s.

Return the number of substrings with dominant ones.

A string has dominant ones if the number of ones in the string is greater than or equal to the square of the number of zeros in the string.
Example 1:

Input: s = "00011"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The substrings with dominant ones are shown in the table below.

```
i	j	s[i..j]	Number of Zeros	Number of Ones
3	3	1	0	1
4	4	1	0	1
2	3	01	1	1
3	4	11	0	2
2	4	011	1	2
```

Example 2:

Input: s = "101101"

Output: 16

Explanation:

The substrings with non-dominant ones are shown in the table below.

Since there are 21 substrings total and 5 of them have non-dominant ones, it follows that there are 16 substrings with dominant ones.
```
i	j	s[i..j]	Number of Zeros	Number of Ones
1	1	0	1	0
4	4	0	1	0
1	4	0110	2	2
0	4	10110	2	3
1	5	01101	2	3
```

## Solution 1

n^2 solution, solves 95% of the testcases.

Use prefix ones count and prefix zeros count, two arrays to hold the counts of zeros and ones at each index

Now, use two for loops to get all possible substrings.

How to validate any substring -> ones = prefix[R] - prefix[L] will give you the ones count for that substring.

same with zeros, and then you can verify.

## Code 1

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        # Prefix sums for ones and zeros
        prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
        prefix_zeros = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if s[i] == '1' else 0)
            prefix_zeros[i + 1] = prefix_zeros[i] + (1 if s[i] == '0' else 0)
        
        count = 0
        # Iterate through all substrings
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                count_ones = prefix_ones[j] - prefix_ones[i]
                count_zeros = prefix_zeros[j] - prefix_zeros[i]
                if count_ones >= count_zeros ** 2:
                    count += 1
        
        return count
```


## Solution 2

Solves 100% testcases, uses a sliding window + deque approach.

Time complexity: O(n*sqrt(n))
