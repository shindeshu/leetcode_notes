## Problem - Hard

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses 
substring

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".
Example 2:

Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".
Example 3:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0

## Solution - Half solved only

In usual "valid parenthesis" we have a stack to keep track of open brackets, and every closing bracket is checked with the top of the stack.

In this problem, we need to find the longest valid parenthesis substring. We can use a stack again to keep track of the *indexes* of open brackets. Whenever we encounter a closed bracket, get the length of the valid substring by subtracting current index from the index at stack-top.

edge cases unsolved.

## Solution2 - By ChatGPT

a two pointer approach, involving two passes over the string.

two count variables: one for openedbrackets, one for closedbrackets.

- if number of open == closed, update the maxLen = open+closed

how to handle cases like ")()(" where the counts are equal but the string is invalid?

- if number of closed > number of open in any loop, reset open=closed=0

we also need to traverse the string from reverse order, why the two passes?

only single pass fails in cases like "(()" where we need to check from backside also.

            elif right > left:
                left = right = 0  # Reset counts when invalid

        left, right = 0, 0

        # Right to left pass
        for char in reversed(s):
            if char == ')':
                right += 1
            else:
                left += 1
            if left == right:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * left)
            elif left > right:
                left = right = 0  # Reset counts when invalid

        return max_length
