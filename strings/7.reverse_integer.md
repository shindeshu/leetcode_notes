## Problem

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

## Reversing Integers (Normal)

Initialize result = 0

Divide by 10 to get remainder, thats the last digit. The integer division is to be carried to the next loop

result = 10*result + remainder

## Reversing Integers (Overflow)

Assume the greatest integer is 26748 (exact value unknown). Input = 26747. Reversed = 74762 (overflow)

How to avoid? Reverse all integers except the last one (7 in this case). check if the reversed integer > than largest-integer-barring-last-digit (i.e. 2674). If yes, then overflow. If < then no overflow. If = then still need to check for the last integer value (if > 8 then overflow, <8 no overflow)
