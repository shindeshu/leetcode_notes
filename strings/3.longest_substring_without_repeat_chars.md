## Problem

Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Trick

two pointers, L=0, and R in a for loop. Keep a visited set of chars

check if s[R] is in visited. if yes, increment L. essentially, if R is in visited, it means the next character makes the substring containing a duplicate (there was already a character same as s[R] in the substring) 

but we cant increment R -> because that wont be a single substring, it will break. So we must increment L till the s[R] character disappears from visited.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        visited = set()
        L = 0
        longest = 0
        for R in range(len(s)):
            while s[R] in visited:
                visited.remove(s[L])
                L += 1
            length = R - L + 1
            if length > longest:
                longest = length
            visited.add(s[R])
        return longest
