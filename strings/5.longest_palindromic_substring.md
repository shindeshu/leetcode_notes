## Problem

Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic substring in s.
Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"


## Naive approach: 

create all possible substrings of the string, and check each of them for palindrome

Time: O(n3)

## Explanation

Instead of trying a two-pointer approach where you start the pointers at either end, and converge while checking

Try starting from the middle, i.e. for each character, treat as if it is the middle of a palindrome, and check while expanding.

i.e. for each character i, initialize L=i, R=i. Decrement and Increment L&R respectively while checking if its still a palindrome. Max is retained.

## Edge Case

Above will fail when there are even number of characters. For that initialize the L=i, R=i+1

So, you will do two passes over the array.

The time complexity is still O(n2). O(n) for traversing array, and O(n) for traversing each time to check palindrome.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        resLen = 0
        res = ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            l,r = i, i
            while l>=0 and r<len(s) and s[l]==s[r]:
                if r-l+1 > resLen:
                    resLen =  r-l+1
                    res = s[l:r+1]
                l -=1 
                r+=1
            l,r = i, i+1
            while l>=0 and r<len(s) and s[l]==s[r]:
                if r-l+1 > resLen:
                    resLen = r-l+1
                    res = s[l:r+1]
                l -=1 
                r+=1
        return res
```
