## Problem

Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
 

## Trick

brute force solution only.

create a set of given words.

now, for each word, check if word[0:1] is in set and word[1:] is in set. if yes, then True
                    check if word[0:1] is in set, and word[1:] is not. then run this recursively on word[1:]

        dp = {}

        def dfs(word):
            if word in dp:
                return dp[word]

                   or prefix in wordset and dfs(suffix):
