## Problem

Given an array of strings strs, group the 
anagrams
 together. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:

There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]

## Solution

What is the definition of anagram? Counter of characters should be equal. We need to group words according to their counters being equal.

We initialize a hashset. The key will be the "count" i.e. an array of length 26 with each index corresponding to the count of that character. The value will be a list of words that correspond to that word

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        hashset = {}
        # key = a counter of characters
        #     e.g. "abd" gives [1,1,0,1]
        # value = list of words corr to the counter
        # so {[1,1,0,1]: ["abd", "bda", "bad"]}
        from collections import defaultdict
        hashset = defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            count = [0]*26
            for char in word:
                count[ord(char)-ord("a")] += 1
            hashset[tuple(count)].append(word)
        
        result = []
        for count, list_of_words in hashset.items():
            result.append(list_of_words)
        return result

```
