## Problem

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1000
Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Example 1:

Input: num = 3749

Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
Example 2:

Input: num = 58

Output: "LVIII"

Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII
Example 3:

Input: num = 1994

Output: "MCMXCIV"

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV


## Trick

1. Use a list containing tuples of character and its value.
2. add the special characters like "IX" "XL" "CM" into this list itself. this means no need to check for 4/9 case
3. the integer division by largest character value is the number of times that char is to be added

```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        # maintain the characters in an ordered list of tuples
        # e.g. [["I", 1], ["IV", 5]]
        # we have two types of characters
        # one is normal: I, V, C, M which point to 1, 5, 100, 1000 etc
        # one is subtractive: IV, CM, XC, XL etc.
        # we keep BOTH in the list
        # so the 4 & 9 case is automatically taken care of
        # we also dont need to check the "allowed to append" scenario
        # since there is no way we will append VV as X = 100 > 50+50 so
        # we will use X there.

        value_symbols = [
            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),
            (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')
        ]

        res = []
        for value, char in value_symbols:
            multiples = num//value
            # 3749 // 1000 = 3 (if statement will run, add three characters)
            # 57 // 1000 = 0 (if statement will not run, loop continues)
            if multiples > 0:
                for _ in range(multiples):
                    res.append(char)
                # mod num for the next iter
                num = num%value
        return "".join(res)
