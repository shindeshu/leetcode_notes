## Problem - Easy

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

## Trick

The max length of the common prefix will be limited by the min length of string in the list

Find that min length first (say, N)
Then iterate N times.
Then iterate through all lists to check if for each string, the char at N position are same.
If not same at any time, break all loops and return result

    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        # longest common prefix
        # length will be limited by the smallest string in
        # the list

        maxLength = min([len(i) for i in strs])
        result = ""
        broken = False
        for i in range(maxLength):
            for j in range(len(strs)):
                if j==0:
                    char = strs[j][i]
                elif strs[j][i] == char:
                    continue
                else:
                    broken = True
                    break
            if broken:
                break
            result += char
        return result
