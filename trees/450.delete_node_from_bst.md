Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.

## Solution

Note that we will be replacing the target node's *value* with something else. its a node.val = something_else operation, and not about rearranging pointers.

Lets say you find that target node. if it has only one subtree, its easy-> you replace the target node with the subtree (e.g. if only left subtree exists, then root = root.left will delete root and replace it with the left subtree.

but what if the target node has BOTH subtrees? how to replace the target node value? we cant use the left subtree val, since that'd break the BST. (Why?? watch neetcode)

we have to use the smallest value from the right subtree. how to find that? traverse the leftmost node of right subtree. replace the target node value with this value. now delete this value from the right subtree, recursively.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return root

        if root.val < key:
            # recursively delete the right subtree
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
            return root
        if root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
            return root
        # we found the node
        if not root.right:
            # if the right subtree is empty, just reassign
            # to delete the node
            return root.left
        if not root.left:
            return root.right
        
        # what if both subtrees of the node-to-delete exist?
        # find the minimum value from the right subtree and
        # assign it to the root node
        # from the right subtree, delete that selected value recursively
        
        # finding the min val from right subtree
        curr = root.right
        while curr.left:
            curr = curr.left
            # now curr is at the minimum value in right subtree
        # reassign root's value
        root.val = curr.val
        # we need to delete curr.val from the right subtree,
        # since we picked that val to replace
        # the remainder tree will still remain the right subtree
        root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, curr.val)
        # root.left stays the same
        return root
