## Problem

Given an n x n array of integers matrix, return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be (row + 1, col - 1), (row + 1, col), or (row + 1, col + 1).

## Solution

basically, for each idx in the top row we compute the min cost to get to the bottom. the minimum of these n is the minimum cost overall.

to elaborate, from "2" compute the mincost through dfs, from "1" compute the mincost through dfs, from "3" the same thing. The min of all these is the result.

This is an O(n2) time because we are iterating through N columns, and for each column we are iterating through N rows. Its also O(n2) space due to the cache. Its possible to do it in O(1) space using DP.

also imp: keep a cache to avoid recomputing, otherwise test cases fail.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(matrix) # num cols
        cache = {}
        def dfs(r, c):
            if r == N:
                # success
                return 0
            if c<0 or c==N:
                # failure / outof bounds
                return float("inf")
            if (r, c) in cache:
                return cache[(r, c)]
            # cost at curr pos, is the curr pos + minimum in the below adjacent position
            ans = matrix[r][c] + \
                    min(dfs(r+1, c), dfs(r+1, c+1), dfs(r+1, c-1))
            cache[(r,c)]=ans
            return ans
        res = float("inf")
        for c in range(N):
            # compute the min sum from 0,c to the bottom row
            res = min(res, dfs(0, c))
        return res
