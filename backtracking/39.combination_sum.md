## Problem

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []

## Solution

Backtracking. At any point of time we can make two decisions- either pick the current number into the s or not. however, how do you handle not picking any duplicates (like [2,2,3] and [2,3,2])?

This you do by not including an integer into the next branch

e.g. when you decide to use "2" in one branch of decision tree, use "2" only in that branch. Dont use "2" at all in the branch where you decided to not use "2".

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        def dfs(i, cur, total):
            if total == target:
                result.append(cur.copy())
                return
            if i >= len(candidates) or total > target:
                return
            
            # include the current int
            cur.append(candidates[i])
            dfs(i, cur, total+candidates[i])
            # not include the current int
            cur.pop()
            dfs(i+1, cur, total)
        dfs(0, [], 0)
        return result
            
            # include i
        return res
```
