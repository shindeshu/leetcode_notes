## Problem

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's 
anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

## Solution

Use a sliding window and hashmaps. Convert p into a hashmap of counts. Create a hashmap count for window. as window slides, udpate the hashmap. check against the pcount and add to result.


## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        # create counts from p
        # in given window of s, compute the counts and check
        # slide the window, update the s_counts and check
        if len(p) > len(s):
            return []

        from collections import Counter, defaultdict
        Pcount = Counter(p)

        Scount = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(len(p)):
            Scount[s[i]] += 1
        # slide the window
        result = [0] if Scount==Pcount else []
        L = 0
        for R in range(len(p), len(s)):
            Scount[s[L]] -= 1
            if Scount[s[L]] == 0:
                del Scount[s[L]]
            Scount[s[R]] += 1
            L+=1
            if Scount == Pcount:
                result.append(L)
        return result
```
