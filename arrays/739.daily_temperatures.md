## Problem

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

## Solution

We start from the right side, since by default the rightmost temperature is 0.

But we dont want the MAXIMUM num on the right of idx. We want the NEXT bigger num on the right! How to do this? Keep a STACK. Keep popping if the top of the stack is smaller than idx. Then naturally, the top of the stack will have the num that is the next bigger!

This is a monotonic stack problem.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = [] # contain a tuple (temp, idx)

        for R in range(len(temperatures)-1, -1, -1):
            # pop from stack until top is bigger than idx
            while stack and stack[-1][0]<temperatures[R]:
                # pop away all the smalls
                stack.pop()
            # now the top of stack is the next biggest num
            
            if not stack:
                ans = 0
            else:
                ans = stack[-1][1] - R
            stack.append([temperatures[R],R])
            temperatures[R] = ans
            
        return temperatures
