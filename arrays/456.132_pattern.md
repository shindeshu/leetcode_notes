## Problem

Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

## Solution

Soln is to use a **monotonically decreasing stack**.

Note that in i->j->k, when we are at position k, the maximum is at j and minimum is at i.

In this stack, we will maintain the maximum values so far. The top of the stack corresponds to the maximum so far, i.e. "j". We will pop off all values from stack that are less than arr[k], because we need the top of the stack to be larger than arr[k]

But that's not enough - we also need the "i" i.e. the value that is less than arr[k], in order words the minimum value so far. 

We can keep both in the SAME stack as a tuple. [ (arr[j], arr[i] ) as a pair of max and min. For the current iteration, i.e. k we simply check the condition arr[i] < arr[k] < arr[j] if true, return true. if not continue on next iteration.


## Code


```python
class Solution:
    def find132pattern(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        curMin = nums[0]
        stack = []
        for num in nums[1:]:
            # while stack is nonempty
            # and top of stack is <= current value
            while stack and stack[-1][0]<=num:
                stack.pop()
            # now the top of stack contains the "j" and "i" value
            # check the condition now
            if stack and (stack[-1][1]<num<stack[-1][0]):
                # this means condition is satisfied
                return True
            # condition not satisfied
            # append to the stack
            stack.append([num, curMin])
            curMin = min(curMin, num)
        return False
