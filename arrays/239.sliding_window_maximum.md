## Problem

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]


## Solution

Brute force: create all possible subsets, and compute teh max. O(n.k) solution

O(n) solution -> monotonic queue.

How? Keep a monotonically decreasing queue. top of the queue is the maximum. append to queue every idx.

how to shift window? append the right. pop the left. how to pop the left since it can be anywhere in the queue?

We keep indices in the queue too. If top-idx is less than left-pointer, it means the max is in the previous window, and we can popleft from the queue.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        import collections
        L, R = 0, 0
        q = collections.deque() # tuple (num, idx)
        result = []

        while R<len(nums):
            # keep popping to maintain dec que
            while q and q[-1][0] < nums[R]:
                q.pop()
            # now all items in queue are smaller than nums[R]
            q.append([nums[R], R])
            # now the top of the q is the max in given window
            # i.e. L to R
                
            if R+1>=k:
                # subarray of size k achieved
                result.append(q[0][0])
                # increment L to keep subarary of fixed size
                # also make sure to pop L if it is at the top
                if L == q[0][1]:
                    q.popleft()
                L += 1
            
            R += 1
        return result

```
